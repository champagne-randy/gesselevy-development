# Rodmap for icenetwork.org

These are some ideas I am ruminating




## Shopify on Roots

* I will build a Proof of Concept (POC) site using [Roots](http://www.roots.cx)
* I will integrate the [Shopify Buy Button](http://shopify.github.io/js-buy-sdk/guide/) api to enable e-commerce



## Shopify Hosted Store

* I will use [Shopify's Timber Theme](https://shopify.github.io/Timber/) to migrate the site to shopify's platform to compare the 2 solutions
